Becoming a **Full Stack Mobile Developer** means mastering the entire application spectrum—from crafting responsive user interfaces to building secure, scalable backend infrastructures.

This roadmap is designed to guide you through the modern technology stack currently preferred by the industry to build high-performance applications.

---

### 1. Frontend: Mobile Layer
Focus on delivering a premium user experience using cross-platform technologies with native performance.

* **Dart & Flutter:** The premier language and toolkit for building high-quality Android and iOS apps from a single codebase.
* **Server-Driven UI (Stac):** An innovative method to update your app's UI/UX instantly from the server without needing to resubmit to the App Store or Google Play.

---

### 2. Backend Ecosystem: Dart-Native
Achieve perfect harmony between client and server through seamless code-sharing.

* **Dart Frog:** A minimalist framework designed for building lightning-fast and lightweight API endpoints.
* **Serverpod:** A powerful backend framework that automatically generates client-side code, allowing Flutter to interact with the server effortlessly.
* **Relic:** A supporting framework to standardize project architecture, ensuring your backend remains clean and maintainable.

---

### 3. High-Performance & Data Specialist
Solutions for extreme scalability and managing massive amounts of data.

* **Golang:** A specialized language for high-concurrency, ideal for handling thousands of simultaneous requests with minimal overhead.
* **PostgreSQL & CockroachDB:** Industry-standard relational databases providing strong data integrity and global scalability (High Availability).

---

### 4. DevOps: Containerization & Orchestration
Ensure your applications run consistently across all environments, from local development to production.

* **Docker:** Packages your code and dependencies into containers to eliminate "it works on my machine" conflicts.
* **Kubernetes (K8s):** An automated system to manage containers at scale, handling auto-scaling and self-healing automatically.

---

### 5. Infrastructure, Security & Monitoring
The physical foundation and oversight systems that keep your servers secure and healthy 24/7.

* **Linux VPS:** Stable and secure server environments (Ubuntu/Debian) to host your backend services.
* **Cloudflare Tunnel:** Secures your infrastructure by connecting your VPS to the internet via encrypted tunnels without exposing public ports.
* **Prometheus & Grafana:** A powerful monitoring duo that collects performance metrics and visualizes them in interactive dashboards.
