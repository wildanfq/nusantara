Becoming a **Full Stack Mobile Developer** means mastering the entire application spectrum—from responsive user interfaces to secure and scalable server infrastructure.

This roadmap is designed to guide you through the modern technologies currently preferred by the industry.

---

### 1. Frontend: Multi-Platform Layer
Focusing on a seamless user experience with high performance across multiple devices.

* **Dart & Flutter:** The primary foundation for building Android, iOS, and Desktop apps from a single codebase with native performance.
* **Jaspr:** A Dart-based web framework that produces pure HTML/CSS for maximum SEO optimization and web loading speeds.
* **Server-Driven UI (Stac):** Enables real-time UI updates directly from the server without requiring a new release on app stores.

---

### 2. Backend Ecosystem: Dart-Native
Creating efficiency through code-sharing between client and server within a single language.

* **Dart Frog:** A minimalist framework focused on speed for building ultra-lightweight API endpoints.
* **Serverpod:** An advanced app server that automatically generates client-side code and features integrated database management.

---

### 3. High-Performance & Data Specialist
Solutions for extreme scalability and massive relational data management.

* **Golang (Go):** A high-concurrency specialist language designed for extreme performance and memory efficiency in large-scale backend systems.
* **PostgreSQL:** The most advanced relational database standard, ensuring strong data integrity for complex queries.

---

### 4. DevOps: Container & Orchestration
Isolating development environments to ensure applications run consistently on any server.

* **Docker:** Wraps applications into containers to ensure dependency consistency across all environments.
* **Kubernetes (K8s):** The industry standard for automated management, auto-scaling, and self-healing systems.

---

### 5. Infrastructure, Security & Monitoring
The foundation of security and system oversight to maintain real-time service stability.

* **Linux VPS (Google Cloud):** A stable and fully controlled server environment to run all application services.
* **Cloudflare Tunnel:** Secures server access by connecting the server to the internet without exposing public ports (preventing cyber attacks).
* **Prometheus & Grafana:** A monitoring duo used to collect system metrics and visualize them into comprehensive infrastructure health dashboards.
