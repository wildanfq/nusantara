Becoming a **Full Stack Mobile Developer** means mastering the entire spectrum of an application—from responsive user interfaces to secure and scalable server infrastructure.

This roadmap is designed to guide you in mastering the modern technologies preferred by the industry today.

---

### 1. Frontend: Mobile Layer
Focus on user experience through cross-platform technology with native performance.

* **Dart & Flutter:** The best combination of language and framework for building Android & iOS applications simultaneously.
* **Server-Driven UI (Stac):** An innovation for updating application interfaces in real-time from the server without needing to re-release on Playstore/AppStore.

---

### 2. Backend Ecosystem: Dart-Native
Creating harmony between client and server using the code-sharing concept.

* **Dart Frog:** A minimalist framework for creating ultra-lightweight API endpoints.
* **Serverpod:** An advanced backend with auto-generate client code capabilities for instant Flutter integration.
* **Relic:** Project structure standardization for cleaner and more measurable backend code.

---

### 3. High-Performance & Data Specialist
Solutions for extreme scalability and massive data management.

* **Golang:** A specialized high-concurrency language for efficiently handling thousands of requests.
* **PostgreSQL & CockroachDB:** Relational database standards with global distribution capabilities and High Availability.

---

### 4. DevOps: Container & Orchestration
Development environment isolation to ensure applications run consistently on any server.

* **Docker:** Packaging applications into containers to avoid dependency conflicts.
* **Kubernetes (K8s):** Automated management for auto-scaling and self-healing systems at scale.

---

### 5. Infrastructure, Security & Monitoring
The foundation for system security and real-time surveillance.

* **Linux VPS:** Stable server environments (Ubuntu/Debian) for running services.
* **Cloudflare Tunnel:** Securing server access without opening public ports to prevent cyber attacks.
* **Prometheus & Grafana:** Metric monitoring systems and visual dashboards to monitor infrastructure health 24/7.
